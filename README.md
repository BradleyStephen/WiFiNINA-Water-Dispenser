# WiFiNINA-Water-Dispenser
This model was developed to simulate a water dispenser that could be used in regions with water scarcity.
Maintaining and adequate drinking water supply is an ongoing issue in the world, and the self-sustainable water dispenser aims to assist in improving the lives of those that do not have access to a sustainable water supply network. This system will involve the implementation of a self-sustainable water dispenser that can be used in remote locations to ensure that residents can have access to drinking water and understand how much drinking water is available to them at any given time. This water dispenser will provide users with a means of collecting, storing, and dispensing rainwater. 

This water dispenser will be composed of a water drum that will be used to collect and store rainwater like that of a city water tower. This drum will be equipped with a water level sensor that will measure and record water levels in the tank. This information can then be used to compute the volume of water in the tank and communicate this volume to the user in a comprehensible way. The purpose of this is to ensure that those living in remote locations are aware of the amount of water they have, which will allow consider their use of water more effectively at any time. For this component, it is important to consider a means of communication that is readable to the user. 
 
The second part of the design is the method of dispensing collected water to the user. For this component of the dispenser, and electromagnetic solenoid valve is attached to the water drum. An ultrasonic sensor which measures distance to an object will be implemented as a means of controlling the flow of the solenoid valve. With this system, if an object is brought towards the sensor, the solenoid valve will receive input voltage and dispense water for the user. Once the object is moved away from the sensor, the electromagnetic solenoid valve will no longer receive input voltage, and the system will stop dispensing water.  
 
To ensure the success of this project, detailed design considerations must be accounted for. Function specifications which include the collection of water, the transmission of water levels to the user, and a functional dispensing method must be met to ensure the successful implementation of this dispenser. It is also important to ensure that this design is simple to use, and that any information communicated to the user is clear and understandable. Lastly, the components of this system require electrical power. Due to the remote locations that this project is designed for, a self-sustainable power source must be considered to maintain this system for users once in use.
